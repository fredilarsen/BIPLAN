## Comments
Comments are human-readable notes present in the source-code. They will be ignored by the compiler. The `#` symbol signals the start of a comment. A comment can make use of an entire line:
```php
# This is a comment
```
or can be placed after a statement:
```php
print "Hello world!" # This is another comment
```
